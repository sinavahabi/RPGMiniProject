Role Playing Game

Languages: Python

Topics: OOP, Error handling, JSON, User interaction

This program is a primary text-base Role Playing Battle Game. Program in written with classes, so it's fully Object-Oriented-Programming.
This battle is between 3 players and 3 enemies. players have access to magics and items as well while enemies don't.
Another feature which comes with it, is a saving progress capability by using json. program will save player progress based on their wins or looses.
Each time that battle is over, afew simple details such as player level, exp, game date and other stuff will be saved via json.
Also program won't crash or stop if user enters a string or unrelated numbers such as negative ones, float numbers, or even integers which are not in menu option list.
This program can be developed as far as possible but, it's enough for me.

Note: Codes documentation and description is more obvious in comments among the codes on each file.
